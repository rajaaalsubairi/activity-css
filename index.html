    <p><strong>Jon Snow</strong> is a major character in the first, second and third seasons. He is played by starring cast member <strong>Kit Harington</strong>, and debuts in the series premiere. Jon is the bastard son of the late <strong>Lord Eddard Stark</strong> of <strong>Winterfell</strong>. He is a steward in the <strong>Night's Watch</strong>. Now serving on the Wall, Jon has found a place of acceptance where the circumstances of his birth are of little importance. He has a pet direwolf named Ghost, and wields the bastard sword, Longclaw, which was a gift from <strong>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</strong> who sees Jon as a surrogate son.</p>
    
    <p>"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come..." â€•<em>Jon Snow</em></p>
